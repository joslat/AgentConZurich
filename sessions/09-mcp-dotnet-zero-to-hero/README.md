## Description

In this session, we’ll explore Model-Context-Protocol (MCP).

We’ll begin with a high-level overview of MCP, illustrating its core concepts through a practical implementation using Semantic Kernel in .NET.
We will also introduce advanced capabilities like elicitation and sampling but get most out of MCP.

From there, we’ll shift focus to security. We’ll examine common vulnerabilities in MCP-based architectures and demonstrate how to securely implement it using OAuth.

Whether you're new to MCP or looking to deepen your expertise, this session will equip you with both the conceptual understanding and hands-on techniques to build secure AI solutions.
